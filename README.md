``delorean`` is a library for clearing up the confusion that is the ``datetime`` module. It will provide natural language improvements for manipulating time, as well as datetime and time abstractions for easy use.

Pretty much make you a badass, time traveller

**Note: This API is in flux still trying to soldify API.**

The overall goal is to improve date and time manipulations, as well as help create a simple way for detecting timezones in various areas as well as providing standardized time in utc.

More to come.
